Sticks visual windows over your desktop + a few extra things!

Release change history...

v1.3 Draft - 12/10/2021
- First upload of private version to GitHub

v1.6 Test - 0811/2021
- First upload of public test version to GitHub (allow for checking some basics on other pc's)

ToDo:
- Make sure all settings are saving/restoring properly, including what is enabled/disabled
- User defined highlighting colours (at the moment, not colour blind friendly)
- Get application path etc. from hwnd
- ...only highlight for certain applications
- Change depth of border for certain window types? Maybe base on client area rather than window area? (e.g. Edge etc. have a shadow around them that make their window area larger than what a border actually would be)
- Re-work versioning and About information
- Auto-update application via GitHub
- Upgrade framework
- Be nice to re-write in a newer framework / .Net Core6/WinUI3?
